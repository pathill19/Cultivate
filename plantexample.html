Basil is a heat lover. Don't bother planting it until the daytime temperatures remain in the 70s and night temperatures are above 50 F. Seeds can be started indoors three to four weeks before your last spring frost date. Unlike many Mediterranean herbs, basil likes a somewhat rich soil and doesn't like to be kept dry.

Space plants about 10 inches apart. They will bush out. Begin pinching the tops off once the plants reach about 6 inches in height. If you don't pinch or harvest, the plants will grow tall and gangly, with few leaves, and will bolt to seed.

Basil is very sensitive to frost and will be one of the first plants to go in the fall. You can extend the season slightly by covering your plants with row covers when frost is threatened. Don't let the row cover touch the leaves. Frost on the outside of the row cover is enough to damage the tender leaves and will likely turn them black.

If you live in a frost-free area, you might want to allow some basil plants to set flowers and self-seed in your garden. Not all varieties will do this successfully.

Growing Basil Indoors
You can grow basil indoors, from seed, seedling or cuttings from your vegetable garden plants. Provide direct sunlight and warmth and feed monthly. An underfed basil plant, indoors or out, will have pale green leaves.
